# Soccer Utilities

A shared utilities library for the Soccer Manager project, providing common models, utilities, and data types that can be shared across all modules (engine, generator, ui).

## üéØ Purpose

The `soccer_utilities` package serves as the foundational layer for the Soccer Manager multi-project workspace. It contains core models and utilities that are used across different modules, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Role

This package sits at the foundation of the Soccer Manager ecosystem:

```

## üì¶ What's Included

### Models

#### Player Model
The core `Player` model represents soccer players with comprehensive attributes:

- **Basic Info**: ID, name, nationality, age, position
- **Skills**: Technical, physical, mental, and positional abilities (0-100 scale)
- **Career**: Club, contract details, market value, reputation
- **Development**: Potential ratings and growth tracking

#### Country Model
Represents countries and regions with:

- **Geographic Data**: Name, continent, FIFA code
- **Soccer Context**: Reputation level for realistic player generation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Adding to Your Project

Add this dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  soccer_utilities:
    path: ../utilities  # Adjust path relative to your project
```

### Basic Usage

```dart
import 'package:soccer_utilities/utilities.dart';

// Create a player
final player = Player(
  id: 'player_001',
  name: 'Lionel Messi',
  age: 36,
  nationality: 'Argentina',
  position: PlayerPosition.rightWing,
  overall: 91,
  potential: 91,
  club: 'Inter Miami',
  // ... other attributes
);

// Create a country
final country = Country(
  name: 'Brazil',
  continent: 'South America',
  fifaCode: 'BRA',
  reputation: CountryReputation.worldClass,
);

// Use in your application logic
print('${player.name} plays for ${player.club}');
print('${country.name} has ${country.reputation.name} reputation');
```

### JSON Serialization

All models support JSON serialization for data persistence:

```dart
// To JSON
final playerJson = player.toJson();
final countryJson = country.toJson();

// From JSON
final playerFromJson = Player.fromJson(playerJson);
final countryFromJson = Country.fromJson(countryJson);
```

## üîß Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Navigate to utilities directory
cd utilities

# Install dependencies
dart pub get

# Run all tests
dart test

# Run specific test file
dart test test/models/player_test.dart
```

### Building

The package uses `json_serializable` for code generation:

```bash
# Generate JSON serialization code
dart run build_runner build

# Watch for changes and auto-generate
dart run build_runner watch
```

### Code Generation

When you modify model classes with `@JsonSerializable()` annotations, you need to regenerate the `.g.dart` files:

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## üìö API Reference

### Exports

The main library exports:

```dart
// Models
export 'src/models/player.dart';      // Player model and enums
export 'src/models/country.dart';     // Country model and enums
```

### Player Enums

- `PlayerPosition`: All soccer positions (goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, forward variants)
- `FootPreference`: left, right, both
- `ContractStatus`: active, expired, pending, terminated

### Country Enums

- `CountryReputation`: unknown, developing, average, good, excellent, worldClass

## ü§ù Integration Examples

### Engine Project

```dart
import 'package:soccer_utilities/utilities.dart';

// Use in match simulation
class MatchSimulator {
  void simulateMatch(List<Player> homeTeam, List<Player> awayTeam) {
    // Access player attributes for simulation logic
    for (final player in homeTeam) {
      final skill = player.overall;
      // ... simulation logic
    }
  }
}
```

### Generator Project

```dart
import 'package:soccer_utilities/utilities.dart';

// Generate players for specific countries
class PlayerGenerator {
  List<Player> generatePlayersForCountry(Country country) {
    return List.generate(25, (index) => Player(
      // ... generate attributes based on country reputation
      nationality: country.name,
    ));
  }
}
```

### UI Project

```dart
import 'package:soccer_utilities/utilities.dart';

// Display player information
class PlayerCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Player player;
  
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: ListTile(
        title: Text(player.name),
        subtitle: Text('${player.position.displayName} ‚Ä¢ ${player.nationality}'),
        trailing: Text('${player.overall}'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

The package includes comprehensive tests for all models:

- **Unit Tests**: Verify model creation, serialization, and validation
- **Property Tests**: Ensure JSON round-trip consistency
- **Edge Cases**: Handle invalid data gracefully

Run the test suite to ensure everything works correctly:

```bash
dart test --coverage
```

## üìã Contributing

When adding new shared functionality:

1. **Models**: Add to `lib/src/models/` with proper JSON serialization
2. **Utilities**: Add helper functions to appropriate modules
3. **Tests**: Include comprehensive test coverage
4. **Exports**: Update `lib/utilities.dart` to expose new public APIs
5. **Documentation**: Update this README with usage examples

### Code Style

- Follow Dart conventions and use `dart format`
- Use meaningful names and comprehensive documentation
- Include JSON serialization for all data models
- Add Equatable mixing for value equality comparison

## üîÑ Version History

- **1.0.0+1**: Initial release with Player and Country models
  - Core player attributes and skills system
  - Country data with reputation levels
  - JSON serialization support
  - Comprehensive test coverage
